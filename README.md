## This Project
In this project, I have downloaded the data set from kaggle(FitBit Fitness Tracker). Which used to answer the following questions.
1) What are some trends in smart device usage?\ 2)How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\ 3)How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy? 

## My Findings

2) The more steps users take, the greater the number of calories burned.
